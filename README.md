# WebScrapping of Population Data (Python project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates web scraping using Python to extract data from a website, process it using Pandas, and store the results in structured formats.
The scraped data is saved as a CSV file for analysis, and the webpage content is stored in an HTML file.

The project highlights practical skills in data extraction, data cleaning, and data storage.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract data from a website using Python.
- Parse and process web content efficiently.
- Convert raw scraped data into structured datasets.
- Store the data in CSV format using Pandas.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code

Libraries Used:

- BeautifulSoup & Requests — Web Scraping

- Pandas — Data Processing & CSV Generation
